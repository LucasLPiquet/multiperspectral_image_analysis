# hiperspectral_image_analysis

## Description
Repository created with the purpose of testing and exploring hiperspectral images in order to compare the differences between what the eyes can perceive and what is actually shown in other, invisible, frequencies

## Objective
The research has already begun, so I'm going to update what has been already done, and what I'm still working at.
The initial problem to be solved was to help the Physics Institute in USP to lessen the amount of time and effort they need to put into taking samples of regions in a specific art piece or document to analyse the chemycal components to it.
To do so, we have access to 16 hyperspectral sub-images of the image (document/art piece) we want to analyse, and we want to group the pixels of this image according to its behavior when relfected by each of the 16 chosen frequencies.

## Creating a RGB image
The idea, initially, is to group the image according to the visual colouring, so that we can divide the main problem into a simpler one: divide the pixels of one specific color, according to the hyperspectral images.
We don't have access to the original RGB image, so we need to build it using the informations in each of the 16 frequencies sub-images. To do so, we took a look at the source of the MISHA capturing software, which has implemented exactly what we need.
It uses the CIE 1931 colour-matching functions to recreate a RGB image.

## Grouping the pixels visually
After that, we can use the RGB image to group the regions with similar colour. To accomplish this, we used k-means clustering (I will, eventually, try other clusterings algorithms), and trained the clustering in two ways: 
- The first one was to train it to find each cluster center in an colourful image
- The second one was training it on the RGB image that we are analysing.

The intuitition behing the first method was to have the clustering to learn how to distinguish between the colours, and group it. Since we know which cluster is associated with each colour, the result is pretty interpretable. However, given that many images, mainly documents, aren't really that colourful, most of the clusters are sparse, and, sometimes, separate pixels that are similar, while grouping pixels taht are visually different.
The intuition behind the second method is to have a clustering algorithm that is adapted to the image we wish to group, in order to have a more representative grouping. Despite that, the groupings are less interpretable, because the clusterings rely completly on the image we are analysing, and doesn't have a direct connection with each color.
We're still analysing which direction to go.

## Grouping the pixels hyperpectrally
After that, we are going to test grouping algorithms, such as TSNE, k-means... to group the pixels of each group generated by the clustered image in terms of their hyperspectral behavior. We've already built a prototype of a TSNE algorithm to group the pixels
